Develop :
----------

-Exhaustive search algorithm
-Greedy heuristics

-------------------------
Analysis for the report :
-------------------------

- Formal computacional complexity
- Sequence of experiments :
	- Number of basic operations
	- Execution time
	- Number of solutions

- Compare the results of experimental and formal analysis
- Determine the largest graph computable on my PC in reasonable time

- Estimate execution time for larger problems
- Report template, max. 8 pages

---------------------------
Graphs for the experiments:
---------------------------

- Graph vertices are 2D points on XoY plane, integer coordinates between [0,100]
- Vertices should neither be coincident nor too close
- Number of edges sharing a vertex is random

- Generate sucessively larger graphs with 4,5,6 vertices using my student number as seed
- Use 12.5%,25%,50%,75% of the maximum number of edges for the number of vertices

-----------
Sugestions:
-----------

- Use NetworkX package
- Store graphs in files

- Adjacency matrix/incidence matrix??

- Might be useful to graphically visualize the graphs and solutions

My problem :
------------

17 	- Find a minimum weight dominating set for a given undirected graph G(V, E), whose vertices
carry positive weights, with n vertices and m edges. 

	-A dominating set of G is a subset D of vertices, such that every vertex not in D is adjacent to,
 at least, one vertex in D.

	- The weight of a dominating set is the sum of its verticesâ€™ weights. A minimum weight
 dominating set is a dominating set whose total weight is as small as possible.
